This not surprising as the standard UMAP embedding is not optimized for Flow cytometry data in any way and is thus only resolving broad cell phenotypes based on a few markers. You can see this by holding down `SHIFT` and clicking on `CD8` under _Markers_, which reduces the label resolution and shows that under a reduced label resolution, the confusion is much lower in the standard UMAP embedding.\n",

When only a few markers (e.g., `CD4` and `CD8`) are active, we can see that most of the neighborhood remain unchanged. When we gradually add more markers, we can see how the the local neighborhood composition difference slowly increases, which is due to the fact that the annotation transformation spaces out all point label clusters.\n",
